## Understanding HTML structures

From our last class, we treated the various ways to add css to your document and considered the use of both the inline and internal css files

In this class, we would be looking at the external css process


From the css file, you will notice that from line 2 to line 18 are basically default settings in css to:

Lines 1 - 6 basicaaly configures the font to be used, and then ensures that there is no whitespace between your work and the border of the document.

lines 8 to 14 - bearing in mind that there will be multiple ul and li elements, we would not want to style them individually, so we declared the primary properties for this elements to inherit once they are declared

Line 16 - 18 is to return the primary properties of the anchor tag only when they are hovered on.
